# CRC16_Collider
A tool for getting CRC16 collisions.

It's rather simplistic. Just run enter id value, and collision desired.

Run the jar by dowloading it then run the command:
java -jar CRC16_collider.jar

If you are re-running the program you can leave fields blank, just press enter and the previous value will be used.
